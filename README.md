This project predicts the chances of heart disease using two machine learning algorithms LightGBM and Random Forest. It helps analyze patient health data and classifies the risk as Low, Medium, or High based on input details like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart rate. The dataset is preprocessed using scaling and train-test splitting to prepare it for model training.

Both LightGBM and Random Forest models are trained and compared based on accuracy, training time, and classification reports. Visualizations such as confusion matrix, ROC curve, feature importance, and correlation heatmap are included to understand model performance and data insights.

The project also allows users to enter their own health details through the console to get a real-time prediction of their heart disease risk. Results show that LightGBM performs slightly better than Random Forest in both speed and accuracy.

In the future, this project can be expanded into a web-based application using Flask or Streamlit for easier access and better user experience. It shows how machine learning can support early detection and awareness of heart disease.
